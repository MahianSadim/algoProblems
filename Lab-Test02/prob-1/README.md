# Find the algorithm.

Sam is faster in his office work compared to others. But he needs a wide table or much space in his desk to complete his work. Because he likes to keep splitting all his random-sized files into two equal groups and put those on the desk until it turns into a single file. After that he keeps piling two groups of files together according to ascending order. Then he repeats his process until all the files in his desk are piled up.

Print the name of the algorithm related to this scenario.

NB. You should write your answer in lower case only. For example binary search.
