# Does Mario get his favorite coin?

Suppose Mario lives in an imaginary world.

In that world, there is only one shop available. The shop contains certain types of coin

with unlimited numbers.

Everyday, Mario buys necessary groceries from that shop. He always gives notes more

than his total bill. As a result, the shopkeeper needs to provide changes to him.

The Shopkeeper always returns the changes in an optimal way


Note: Available coins in the shop are: 1,2,7,9,13,25

On the other hand, Mario has a favorite number, which is 7



You will be given two integer numbers P and T where P is the amount given by Mario to

the shopkeeper and T is the total bill. The shopkeeper gives the necessary changes for

the amount P-T.

Here P is always greater than T.

Now write a program that will print "Yes" if Mario's favorite coin is available in the
change.
Otherwise, print "No".
