# New Species

A few Russian scientists have invented a new species of an animal. The DNA sequence

of that animal is confidential. One DNA sequence has some alphabets (a to z) and digits

(0-9). In the sequence, every alphabet comes along with an integer digit on its right

side. The secret of the DNA sequence is, alphabets are arranged in descending order

and the digits are arranged in ascending order.

One day, the scientists needed to send the DNA data to other Russian scientists. While

sending the data by email, the sequence was misplaced by hackers. But scientists know

the secret (original order) of the DNA sequence. Now scientists need your help to

reform the DNA sequence.


Input:

The first line contains a string, the misplaced DNA sequence.

Output:

Display the original DNA sequence.
